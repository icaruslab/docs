With the **first release** of Icarus Project's documentations, we are happy to announce the results of our research and documentation process.
{{< /alert >}}

**The project idea** started as an individual initiative in 2017, trying to collect, test, document, and develop Internet censorship circumvention techniques as a response to the rise of Internet censorship at the time.

**In 2019** the idea started to be realized through one year fellowship program supported by Open Tech Fund (OTF) Information Controls Fellowship program, and hosted by [Stratosphere Lab](https://www.stratosphereips.org/team) at the Czech Technical University in Prague (CVUT).

**We started by collecting, testing, and documenting as many ideas and methods as we can.**

**Now,** we present these guides and documentations to serve as the core of this project. We are hoping that this initial release should it prove - useful and effective - will receive and integrate different contributions from the interested communities, towards developing and maintaining an accessible and user-friendly online repository of accumulative experience and research.
